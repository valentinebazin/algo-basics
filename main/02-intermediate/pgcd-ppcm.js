 * Write a function that computes the GCD - greatest common divisor (fr: PGCD - Plus grand diviseur commun) between the two provided numbers.

 * The GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both.
 * E.g :
 *  - GCD of 6 and 3 is 3
 *  - GCD of 15 and 25 is 5
 * 
 * You may want to use the remainder operator : "%" which returns the remainder left over when one operand is divided by a second.
 * E.g :
 *  - 5 % 2 = 1
 *  - 6 % 3 = 0
 *  - 8 % 3 = 2
